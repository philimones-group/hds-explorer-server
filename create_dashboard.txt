HDS-Explorer Dashboard is designed using ReactJS under Grails Framework

cd src/main/webapp

npx create-react-app main-dashboard

Dashboard was designed by https://github.com/Edmilson-Filimone, the original draft was under https://github.com/Edmilson-Filimone/hds-dashboard,
Was integrated in HDS-Explorer by paulphilimone, the project will receive futher updates under HDS-Explorer Server repository


1. To build the react dashboard you must go to the project directory
-----------------------------------------------------------------

cd src/main/webapp/main-dashboard

2. Execute the script
---------------------

sh build-dashboard.sh

This will generate two bundle files: index-bundle-dashboard.js and index-bundle-dashboard.css,
these files will be automatically copied to grails-app/assets directory to be integrated with grails,
after that you can commit the changes of the output to the main grails project, we could have used webpack but we didnt have the time to configure it
